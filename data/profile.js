  bio:
    "With over eight years of research and engineering experience, I specialize in the design and integration of passive components and antennas for microwave and millimeter‑wave applications. My work advances the modeling and design of these components through machine learning, focusing on Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW), Ridge Gap Waveguide (RGW) and additive manufacturing. I optimize miniature, low‑cost system‑in‑package solutions for Internet‑of‑Space applications and bring a global perspective gained through collaborations in Algeria, France, Turkey, Egypt, Taiwan, and Canada.",
